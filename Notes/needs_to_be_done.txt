What needs to be done?

    - work with text to make it nicer
        - TextMesh pro
    - create checkpoints to move advance in game
        - create more platform functionality DONE (for now)
            - normal (Default) DONE
            - pulls player towards it (Magnet) DONE
            - destroys enemies (Destroyer)
                - kill enemies going through after circle destroys
            - healing (Healthy) DONE
            - find player and set platform right below - always diagonal (SaveMe) DONE
            - creates extra long platform in whatever orientation player sets (Extraaa) DONE
                - triples the width
        - new checkpoints change the player's color, have different enemies, collectables and platforms
            - If player goes more than 100 farther than the previous high score, change to another random color
        - SYNERGIES???
        - add collectables!!!
            - phase through enemies
            - time is slowed for one
            - laser beam destroys enemies in path in front
            - adds ceiling runner functionality
            - double platform setting?
            - hitting enemies gives health
            - decreasing/increasing hitbox
        - create new enemies
            - cluster enemy (cannot follow player but move as a unit (makes use of the destroyer platform))
            - enemy that spawns poison creep in its path
            - one enemy that moves at random quick intervals (like jumping spiders from Isaac)
            - enemies with status effects can do things to platforms (ex: burning)
    - platforms have functionality, but are completely different from collectables
        - platforms can perform actions, but not give abilities to player
        - collectables do opposite, sending abilities to player while being consumed after touch (rarity depends on ability)
            - SOME CAN BE HARMFUL (increasing hitbox for period of time)
            - generic collectable object (mystery abilities)
            - some abilities will be full game use, others will be for certain time
    - seeded runs??
