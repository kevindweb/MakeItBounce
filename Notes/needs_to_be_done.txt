What needs to be done?

    - create platform scene in load view to check and set available platforms for game use
        - create scrollable list of extra platforms to choose from
    - make bottom destroyer only destroy player and nothing else
    - create checkpoints to move advance in game
        - new checkpoints change the player's color, have different enemies, collectables and platforms
        - SYNERGIES???
        - add collectables!!!
            - phase through enemies
            - time is slowed for one
            - laser beam destroys enemies in path in front
            - adds ceiling runner functionality
            - double platform setting?
            - hitting enemies gives health
        - create more platform functionality
            - normal (Default)
            - pulls player towards it (Magnet)
            - destroys enemies (Destroyer)
            - healing (Healthy)
            - find player and set platform right below - always diagonal (SaveMe) 
        - create new enemies
            - cluster enemy (cannot follow player but move as a unit (makes use of the destroyer platform))
            - enemy that spawns poison creep in its path

    - platforms have functionality, but are completely different from collectables
        - platforms can perform actions, but not give abilities to player
        - collectables do opposite, sending abilities to player while being consumed after touch (rarity depends on ability)
            - generic collectable object (mystery abilities)
            - some abilities will be full game use, others will be for certain time
