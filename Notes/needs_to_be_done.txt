What needs to be done?

    - create platform scene in load view to check and set available platforms for game use
        - get button moving platforms functionality
        - create scrollable list of extra platforms to choose from
    - create checkpoints to move advance in game
        - new checkpoints change the player's color, have different enemies, collectables and platforms
        - add collectables
            - phase through enemies
            - time is slowed for one
        - create more platform functionality
            - healing
        - create new enemy that spawns multiple enemies
            - cluster enemy (cannot follow player but move as a unit (makes use of the destroyer platform))
    - achievements?
